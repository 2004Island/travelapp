Then use npm run start to use webpack to create dist folder along with main.js file

Then use sudo sass src/client/styles/index.scss dist/index.css to convert the scss file to css for the page 

Then use npm run start-server to activate server.js, go to localhost:4202 to see the page run

When inputting addresses and dates and pressing the book it button you should see the post request in terminal. 

The background header image will update to show an image of the state/region the address is in. (testing with the example address will post images of Wyoming)

The website displays the image by changing the background section.
